##  Eclipse Groovy script to remove the 'busy' image from the WebBrowser Editor

Now that I'm doing [AngularJS](http://blog.diniscruz.com/search/label/AngularJS) and [Firebase](http://blog.diniscruz.com/search/label/Firebase) development inside Eclipse, there was a little 'thing' that was starting to drive me crazy: **_The animation icon on the top right of the Eclipse WebBrowser!_**  
**  
**Apart from the [mosaic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)) 2000s look (which is kinda ok), there is a big problem with pages that keep running for a while: **_the animation doesn't stop!_**  
**_  
_**This means that if you are developing inside Eclipse, there is this 'thing' (i.e. the top right icon) that keeps moving and demand my brain's attention:

Since there didn't seem to be an preference or option to disable this behaviour, it was time to open up the [Eclipse Grovy REPL Scripting Environment](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-grovy-repl-scripting-environment) and fix it with a script :)

**The solution**

After a quick prototyping, I come up with this script to remove all icons from all opened WebBrowser editors ([gist here](https://gist.github.com/DinisCruz-Dev/9294163)):

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_03_16.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jBgGQ6N247A/UxIhZPf5AEI/AAAAAAAAIAM/AlV39GKcTIo/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.03.16.png)

  
After execution the icon is not there anymore :)

**How I found the solution**

Here are the steps I took to find the _busy _object to set the **_visible_** value to false

1) in the [Grovy REPL](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-grovy-repl-scripting-environment) I started by getting a list the **_ids_** of all current opened Eclipse views, but there didn't seem to be any web browser in there:

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_16_00.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GwPzWbfq9BM/UxIkAje3ijI/AAAAAAAAICE/PA-Kz7ldc3w/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.16.00.png)

  
2) then I looked at the list the **_ids_** of all current opened editors, and found one that sounded promising:  **org.eclipse.ui.browser.editor**

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_07_39.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-z-F5c0S0tZg/UxIjQuHTEiI/AAAAAAAAIAc/urmCxzxBrcs/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.07.39.png)

  
3) to confirm that that was the one I wanted, I looked at the **_titles_ **of the current editors, and confirmed that the browser window I want to capture was there (the title was "_Angular with Firebase Lite_");

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_07_48.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5pHO5nyysww/UxIjQqo25VI/AAAAAAAAIAg/UpEskvvbB5o/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.07.48.png)

  
4) now that I knew the title, it was easy to get an **_EditorReference_** to it:

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_08_09.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lu_e8KAD5Nc/UxIjQtP3dAI/AAAAAAAAIAw/2b9aNTsC600/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.08.09.png)

  
5) everytime I have an object reference that I want to take a look, I call the _show({object}) _viewer, since that will give me a nice **_TreeViewer_** of all methods, fields and properties ( see [Viewing Eclipse and SWT objects (Workbench, Display and Shell) using Groovy's ObjectBrowser and using TeamMentor's Plugin ObjectBrowser](http://blog.diniscruz.com/2014/01/viewing-eclipse-and-swt-objects.html) for more details how this works)

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_08_30.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q_dfLBplstI/UxIjRFLJpyI/AAAAAAAAIAo/9RaO7hk-AVU/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.08.30.png)

  
6) in this case we don't want the _EditorReference _object. What we really want is the actually editor, which can be retrieved by invoking the **_getEditor(true) _**method (note how the object we are currently seeing in the **_Object Browser_** is the **_org.eclipse.ui.internal.WebBrowserEditor_**)

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_10_03.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tdsH607kVm0/UxIjT22EgUI/AAAAAAAAIBQ/pFXHyMjXiI4/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.10.03.png)

  
Here is a better view of this object:

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_10_31.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-09n4oQHp7zc/UxIjSPmeXJI/AAAAAAAAIA8/zMZvuaCUC2E/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.10.31.png)

  
7) looking at the **org.eclipse.ui.internal.WebBrowserEditor **object, the one that called my attention was the **_webBrowser_** field (which is an **_org.eclipse.ui.internal.browser.BrowserViewer_** object)

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_10_39.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LSCwcMAMEqk/UxIjSvPssOI/AAAAAAAAIBA/HCxuuDKroG4/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.10.39.png)

  
8) Inside the **_webBrowser_** object I found the **_busy_** field (which is an **_org.eclipse.ui.internal.browser.BusyIndicator_** object)

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_10_47.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CqkN6Vr96wI/UxIjVzlrUkI/AAAAAAAAIBw/P_G60YOIO4w/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.10.47.png)

  
9) and finally inside the** busy **object I found the **_visible_** property (ie the **_getVisible_** and **setVisible **methods)

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_11_19.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QUUjZ_5lOss/UxIjT-aAJeI/AAAAAAAAIBM/i7nryiTwpyA/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.11.19.png)

  
10) back in the REPL, it was time to do the same thing programatically.

First I got a reference to the **_webBrowser_** field:

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_11_49.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HayX1JGbjn0/UxIjU9GnJ7I/AAAAAAAAIBg/alGnAggZasU/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.11.49.png)

  
... and then the **_busy_** field:

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_12_11.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CVk5T8aGK1w/UxIjU2p2LAI/AAAAAAAAIBY/jUzCS6vMh9k/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.12.11.png)

  
11) Once I had the reference to the **_busy_** field, it was easy to make it invisible (by just setting the **_visible_** property to **_false_**)

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_12_54.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3KIF7Oe9qlQ/UxIjWDLGCXI/AAAAAAAAIBs/gqRFmLubIOk/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.12.54.png)

12) final step was to write a generic script that would work on all opened browser editor windows (a robust script would use the same trick I used in the integration with the Fortify plugin, where a callback is received on every new view opened (i.e. we could wait for new instances of the **org.eclipse.ui.browser.editor **to be opened, and apply the fix then))

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_31_49.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41Grvw2_JjM/UxIn-rZyt4I/AAAAAAAAICQ/KiPON2pmXKk/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.31.49.png)

  
To demonstrate the script in action, here it is the browser before:

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_17_56_29.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eKDlN41YFbA/UxIflwzYKuI/AAAAAAAAH_s/5S6-izZtFfQ/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+17.56.29.png)

  
... and here it is after:

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-03-01_at_18_04_41.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f3ygIHeD9rk/UxIhZDNeUzI/AAAAAAAAIAQ/PVMfnuF_K5k/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-01+at+18.04.41.png)

  
Note: another way to to stop the constant animation was to just set the **_stop_** value to _false_, but this would only work for the current opened page (i.e. the animation would be back on page reload)
