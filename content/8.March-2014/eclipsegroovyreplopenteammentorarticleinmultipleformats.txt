##  Eclipse Groovy REPL - Open TeamMentor Article in multiple formats 

Part of the new [TeamMentor Fortify Eclipse plugin v1.6.0](http://1.6.0%20release%20of%20the%20eclipse%20fortify%20plugin/) ([update site here](http://eclipse-plugin-builder.azurewebsites.net/), [installation instructions here](http://blog.diniscruz.com/2013/12/installing-eclipse-plugin-builder.html)) is a really powerful TeamMentor and Eclipse API which can be easily accessed via the included Groovy REPL.

In this first post (of several in this topic) I will show how to use the APIs to **_Open TeamMentor Article in multiple formats_**  
**_  
_**  
The first step is to open the **Util - Write Script (TeamMentor DSL) **view (which is the name of the provided Groovy REPL) using the **_TeamMentor_** menu (note that the_ **Advanced mode features**** **_config property needs to be checked, or the **_Advanced and Debug Features _**sub-menu will not be visible):

.... alternatively if you are using Kepler, you can use the 'Quick Access' search bar to find that view. Just search for **_'Team..' _**and you should see the view **_Write TeamMentor Script_**

This is what the Groovy REPL script UI looks like:

...which when executed using the default script, will open up a browser window with TeamMentor's guidance for 'Cross-Site Scripting' (which is what the command **_openArticle('Cross-Site Scripting') _**will do:

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2014-01-28_at_15_35_43.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oBup9YUgsoQ/UufO08WPw7I/AAAAAAAAF50/t5j6eS214TQ/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-01-28+at+15.35.43.png)

  


The command **openArticle('Cross-Site Scripting')  **can be executed in that environment because it is being automatically mapped to the _tm.teammentor.TeamMentor _class ([see code here](https://github.com/TeamMentor/TeamMentor_Eclipse_Plugin/blob/master/TeamMentor.Eclipse.PlugIn.Fortify/src/tm/teammentor/TeamMentorAPI.java#L266)).

This is probably easier to understand using the groovy code sample below ([gist](https://gist.github.com/DinisCruz/8671008#file-2-same-as-1-but-using-new-teammentorapi-object-groovy)), where:

1) the **_tm.teammentor.*_** package is imported  
2) an **_TeamMentorAPI_** object is created  
3) the **_open_Article_** method from **_TeamMentorAPI_** is called:

A really nice helper feature that this Eclipse Plugin has is the **_ObjectBrowser_** ([see code here](https://github.com/TeamMentor/TeamMentor_Eclipse_Plugin/blob/master/TeamMentor.Eclipse.PlugIn.Fortify/src/tm/eclipse/swt/controls/extra/ObjectBrowser.java)) which provides a nice Table view of any Java object.

To see it in action (inside the Groovy REPL) just use the syntax _**show({target object}).**_

For example here is how to see the details of the **_teamMentor_** variable (which is an instance of the **_tm.teammentor.TeamMentor_** class):  


> **_show(teamMentor)_**

After execution, a new **_Object Browser_** view should appear, which can be placed anywhere on the Eclipse UI, and on the screenshot below it is placed under the Groovy REPL window:

The _ObjectBrowser _allows the easy view of all fields and getters:

Expanding the special __methods _node, will show the current public and private methods of the selected object (which can be quite down the original object tree)

Note how in the image above we can see that there are a number of **_view_*_** methods for the **_TeamMentorAPI_** class: _**view_Article , view_Content, view_Html, view_Jsonp, view_Raw**. _

Let's see them in action:

_**view_Article **(shows fully formatted article's content with edit links if the current user has edit privileges). _Note that this is the same result as calling **_openArticle(...) _**shown above

_**view_Html** (shows article's HTML with just a simple TM banner)_

_**view_Contents **(shows article's raw content, which in this case was written in Markdown)_  
_  
_

_view_Raw __(shows article's XML content, which is an exact copy of the article's xml file saved to disk)_

_**view_Jsonp **(shows an article's raw content (i.e. XML file) in javascript JSONP format (making it easier to consume from Javascript)_  
_  
_

Wrapping up this post, note how there are other TeamMentor specific methods available: set TM server, login into TM, set Session ID, etc:
